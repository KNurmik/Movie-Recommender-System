Using and extending probabilistic matrix factorization implemented from scratch with NumPy and JAX to accurately predict ratings users will give to movies for a movie recommender system. We extend our models by introducing a non-linear activation function for the user and movie latent features, and by designing the latent features to represent the quality of movies.

This project was created as part of JSC370: Data Science II at the University of Toronto by Karl Hendrik Nurmeots and Samuel Vedrik. The starter code for the project was provided by David Duvenaud and Harsh Panchal.
